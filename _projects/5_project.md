Development of soft materials that mimic the ability of living organisms to sense the changes in their environment through various signals and respond in a way that optimizes processes is one of the challenges in emerging fields of biomedicine, soft robotics and energy materials. For a long time, we have relied on polymeric materials in countless industries for their high kinetic and thermodynamic stability, but recent efforts to create a more sustainable and environment-friendly future have cast a negative shadow on polymeric materials for their same property. As a result, the field of supramolecular polymers started to gain increasing attention. Supramolecular polymers, where the building blocks of the material assemble via non-covalent interactions to form a dynamic material, can have mechanical properties of plastics but also provide ease of processability, recycling and self-healing due to their reversible nature.

Interestingly, the concept of supramolecular polymers is far from new; in living systems, proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamically form long, ordered supramolecular fibrils and depolymerize for vital cell functions. In the same manner, such specific inter and intramolecular interactions can be utilized to rationally design materials using bottom-up approaches. In this context, biomimetic multifunctional materials can be designed by using building blocks, such as peptide-based motifs and conjugates with organic and inorganic molecules, that predictably self-assemble and interact to generate functions similar to or surpassing those of natural products. For example, peptide amphiphiles are biomolecules made up of hydrophobic alkyl chains and a peptide sequence containing Î²-sheet forming amino acid residues that self-assemble in solution to form supramolecular nanofibers with long-range order. Because of their increased stability due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, these nanofibers provide excellent scaffolds for development of stimuli-responsive materials.

In different projects, we investigated their self-assembly in solution, secondary structure formation and interaction with water and ions in solution.
