abstract = {Abstract Amyloid-like peptide nanofibrils (PNFs) are abundant in nature providing rich bioactivities and playing both functional and pathological roles. The structural features responsible for their unique bioactivities are, however, still elusive. Supramolecular nanostructures are notoriously challenging to optimize, as sequence changes affect self-assembly, fibril morphologies, and biorecognition. Herein, the first sequence optimization of PNFs, derived from the peptide enhancing factor-C (EF-C, QCKIKQIINMWQ), for enhanced retroviral gene transduction via a multiparameter and a multiscale approach is reported. Retroviral gene transfer is the method of choice for the stable delivery of genetic information into cells offering great perspectives for the treatment of genetic disorders. Single fibril imaging, zeta potential, vibrational spectroscopy, and quantitative retroviral transduction assays provide the structure parameters responsible for PNF assembly, fibrils morphology, secondary and quaternary structure, and PNF-virus-cell interactions. Optimized peptide sequences such as the 7-mer, CKFKFQF, have been obtained quantitatively forming supramolecular nanofibrils with high intermolecular β-sheet content that efficiently bind virions and attach to cellular membranes revealing efficient retroviral gene transfer.},

	Abstract = {Gene therapy via retroviral vectors holds great promise for treating a variety of serious diseases. It requires the use of additives to boost infectivity. Amyloid-like peptide nanofibers (PNFs) were shown to efficiently enhance retroviral gene transfer. However, the underlying mode of action of these peptides remains largely unknown. Data-mining is an efficient method to systematically study structure--function relationship and unveil patterns in a database. This data-mining study elucidates the multi-scale structure--property--activity relationship of transduction enhancing peptides for retroviral gene transfer. In contrast to previous reports, we find that not the amyloid fibrils themselves, but rather µm-sized β-sheet rich aggregates enhance infectivity. Specifically, microscopic aggregation of β-sheet rich amyloid structures with a hydrophobic surface pattern and positive surface charge are identified as key material properties. We validate the reliability of the amphiphilic sequence pattern and the general applicability of the key properties by rationally creating new active sequences and identifying short amyloidal peptides from various pathogenic and functional origin. Data-mining---even for small datasets---enables the development of new efficient retroviral transduction enhancers and provides important insights into the diverse bioactivity of the functional material class of amyloids.},

@article{Yolamanova2013,
	Abstract = {Inefficient gene transfer and low virion concentrations are common limitations of retroviral transduction1. We and others have previously shown that peptides derived from human semen form amyloid fibrils that boost retroviral gene delivery by promoting virion attachment to the target cells2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, application of these natural fibril-forming peptides is limited by moderate efficiencies, the high costs of peptide synthesis, and variability in fibril size and formation kinetics. Here, we report the development of nanofibrils that self-assemble in aqueous solution from a 12-residue peptide, termed enhancing factor C (EF-C). These artificial nanofibrils enhance retroviral gene transfer substantially more efficiently than semen-derived fibrils or other transduction enhancers. Moreover, EF-C nanofibrils allow the concentration of retroviral vectors by conventional low-speed centrifugation, and are safe and effective, as assessed in an ex vivo gene transfer study. Our results show that EF-C fibrils comprise a highly versatile, convenient and broadly applicable nanomaterial that holds the potential to significantly facilitate retroviral gene transfer in basic research and clinical applications.},
