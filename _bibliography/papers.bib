	Abstract = {The development of synthetic structures that mimic mechanical actuation in living matter such as autonomous translation and shape changes remains a grand challenge for materials science. In living systems the integration of supramolecular structures and covalent polymers contributes to the responsive behaviour of membranes, muscles and tendons, among others. Here we describe hybrid light-responsive soft materials composed of peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymers chemically bonded to spiropyran-based networks that expel water in response to visible light. The supramolecular polymers form a reversibly deformable and water-draining skeleton that mechanically reinforces the hybrid and can also be aligned by printing methods. The noncovalent skeleton embedded in the network thus enables faster bending and flattening actuation of objects, as well as longer steps during the light-driven crawling motion of macroscopic films. Our work suggests that hybrid bonding polymers, which integrate supramolecular assemblies and covalent networks, offer strategies for the bottom-up design of soft matter that mimics living organisms.},

	abstract = {Self-assembly is a process whereby molecules organize into structures with hierarchical order and complexity, often leading to functional materials. Biomolecules such as peptides, lipids and DNA are frequently involved in self-assembly, and this leads to materials of interest for a wide variety of applications in biomedicine, photonics, electronics, mechanics, etc. The diversity of structures and functions that can be produced provides motivation for developing theoretical models that can be used for a molecular-level description of these materials. Here we overview recently developed computational methods for modeling the self-assembly of peptide amphiphiles (PA) into supramolecular structures that form cylindrical nanoscale fibers using molecular-dynamics simulations. Both all-atom and coarse-grained force field methods are described, and we emphasize how these calculations contribute insight into fiber structure, including the importance of β-sheet formation. We show that the temperature at which self-assembly takes place affects the conformations of PA chains, resulting in cylindrical nanofibers with higher β-sheet content as temperature increases. We also present a new high-density PA model that shows long network formation of β-sheets along the long axis of the fiber, a result that correlates with some experiments. The β-sheet network is mostly helical in nature which helps to maintain strong interactions between the PAs both radially and longitudinally.}

In computer simulations, Tg is often calculated from the gradual change in macroscopic properties. Precise determination of this change depends on the fitting protocols. We previously proposed a robust data-driven approach to determine Tg from the molecular dynamics simulation data of a coarse-grained semiflexible polymer model. In contrast to the global macroscopic properties, our method relies on high-resolution microscopic details. Here, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by using various dimensionality reduction and clustering methods and apply it to an atomistic model of acrylic polymers. Our study reveals the explicit contribution of the side chain and backbone residues in influencing the determination of the glass transition temperature.}",

abstract  ="Supramolecular-covalent hybrid polymers have been shown to be interesting systems to generate robotic functions in soft materials in response to external stimuli. In recent work supramolecular components were found to enhance the speed of reversible bending deformations and locomotion when exposed to light. The role of morphology in the supramolecular phases integrated into these hybrid materials remains unclear. We report here on supramolecular-covalent hybrid materials that incorporate either high-aspect-ratio peptide amphiphile (PA) ribbons and fibers{,} or low-aspect-ratio spherical peptide amphiphile micelles into photo-active spiropyran polymeric matrices. We found that the high-aspect-ratio morphologies not only play a significant role in providing mechanical reinforcement to the matrix but also enhance photo-actuation for both light driven volumetric contraction and expansion of spiropyran hydrogels. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that water within the high-aspect-ratio supramolecular polymers exhibits a faster draining rate as compared to those in spherical micelles{,} which suggests that the high-aspect-ratio supramolecular polymers effectively facilitate the transport of trapped water molecules by functioning as channels and therefore enhancing actuation of the hybrid system. Our simulations provide a useful strategy for the design of new functional hybrid architectures and materials with the aim of accelerating response and enhancing actuation by facilitating water diffusion at the nanoscopic level.",
